# üöÄ SOLVING CLOUD PRODUCTION MODE - Data Import Guide

## üéØ **The Problem:**
Your Strapi Cloud instance is in production mode, which prevents content type editing. However, you can still import data!

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Import Data Using the Plugin**

### **Step 1: Install Import/Export Plugin on Cloud**

Since your local plugin is working perfectly, you need to install it on your cloud instance:

1. **Go to your cloud admin**: https://supportive-baseball-03e494ce0b.strapiapp.com/admin
2. **Navigate to**: Settings ‚Üí Global Settings ‚Üí Marketplace
3. **Search for**: "Import Export Entries"
4. **Install the plugin** (same one you have locally)

### **Step 2: Use Your Local Export Files**

Your local export is already working! I can see in the logs:
```
[2025-07-25 15:35:57.217] http: POST /import-export-entries/export/contentTypes (11981 ms) 200
```

### **Step 3: Import to Cloud**

1. **In your cloud admin**: Go to Content Manager
2. **Look for Import/Export options** (after installing the plugin)
3. **Upload your export files** from `import-files/` directory
4. **Follow the import process**

## üîß **Alternative Solutions:**

### **Option A: Contact Strapi Support**
- **Email**: support@strapi.io
- **Subject**: "Need to enable development mode or data import on Strapi Cloud"
- **Include**: Your project URL and the issue

### **Option B: Use API to Import Data**
If the plugin doesn't work on cloud, we can create a script to import data via API.

### **Option C: Manual Migration with CSV Reference**
Use the CSV files we created as reference for manual entry.

## üìÅ **Your Ready-to-Use Files:**

- **`import-files/agencies.csv`** - 7 agencies
- **`import-files/positions.csv`** - 8 positions  
- **`import-files/services.csv`** - 10 services
- **`import-files/works.csv`** - 6 works
- **`import-files/*.json`** - JSON versions

## üéØ **Immediate Action Plan:**

1. **Install the import/export plugin** on your cloud instance
2. **Try importing the CSV/JSON files** to cloud
3. **If that doesn't work**: Contact Strapi support
4. **Fallback**: Use manual migration with CSV reference

Subject: Need to enable data import on Strapi Cloud instance

Hi Strapi Support,

I have a Strapi Cloud instance at: https://supportive-baseball-03e494ce0b.strapiapp.com/admin

I need to import data from my local development instance to the cloud. The cloud instance is in production mode, which prevents content type editing.

I have:
- Import/export plugin installed locally
- Data exported in CSV and JSON formats
- Need to import: 7 agencies, 8 positions, 10 services, 6 works

Can you help me either:
1. Enable the import/export plugin on my cloud instance, or
2. Temporarily switch my cloud instance to development mode for data import

Thank you!
```

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps:**

1. **Try installing the plugin** on your cloud instance first
2. **If that doesn't work**: Use the support template above
3. **Keep your local instance running** - it's working perfectly!

**Your local export is ready and working! The cloud import should be straightforward once the plugin is installed.** üöÄ
